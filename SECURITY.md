# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release on the default branch. If you are running an older commit or a fork, please rebase/upgrade before reporting issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

- security@algorand.foundation

### What to Include

Please include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected components (pages, API routes, packages)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or stack traces
- Your suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

### Response Targets

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide a status update within 10 business days

Timelines may vary depending on severity and complexity.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We prefer coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Please allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation before public disclosure.

## Vulnerability Rewards

This repository does not currently operate a public bug bounty. If that changes, it will be documented here.
